<%= @user.email %>, You've been invited to alpha test the new LombardPress rebuild

You can sign into the site at <%= @url %>. Your username is <%= @user.email %> and your password is <%= @user.password %>. Your permission level is <%= @user.role %> which means can view both public texts and individual drafts that you have been approved for. I have approved you to view Petrus Plaoul, Lectio 1 at https://lombardpress2.herokuapp.com/text/lectio1. At the present time you will not be availble to view other drafts without requesting and receiving permission from the editor.

The site is still in development so there may be many problems. But I would love your feedback, ideas, and suggestions. If you have time to look at the site, please send your comments to jeffreycwitt@gmail.com
